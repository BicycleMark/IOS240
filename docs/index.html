        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is an iOS class. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin.iOS development environment with either the iOS Simulator or an iOS device to run the exercise on.
        Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Touch is a fundamental part of the iOS experience.  Almost all user interaction with running applications are done by touching the screen,
            and iOS devices have very responsive displays that can handle 5 to 11 touches simultaneously.
            As developers, making good use of touch and gestures can have a huge impact on both ease of use of your applications as well as user enjoyment.

        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Respond to touch events</li>
           <li>Handle multiple touch events</li>
           <li>Implement gestures</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS240/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS240/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <div class="objective">Respond to touch events</div>
            <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this individual exercise, you'll add touch event handling to an existing iOS application.
            </li>

            <li>
              <div class="objective">Create a multi-touch Paint app</div>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            Next, you'll respond to multiple touch events to complete a multi-touch paint application.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Use a gesture recognizer</div>
            <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise you'll use a gesture recognizer to move an image within a view controller.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Use multiple gestures simultaneously</div>
            <a href="./parts/part4.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In the final exercise, you'll use three gestures simultaneously to transform an image on screen.
            </li>
        </ol>
